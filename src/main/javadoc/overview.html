<h1>Functions and Constants</h1>

<p>The functions and constants described here can be used in the expression editor of the TOP Framework.</p>

<p>Each expression represents either a phenotype class, a constant/value (list) or a function with a set of
arguments (which are also expressions) and has a particular data type (number, text,
boolean or date-time). For example, a number expression is either a numeric phenotype
class (e.g. weight), a numeric constant/value (list) (e.g. pi or [1, 2, 3]) or a function returning a number
expression. A function converts its arguments into a single expression of a defined data type.</p>

<p>The functions and constants are grouped by category (package). For detailed information about a function or a constant, 
please click on the corresponding package and then on the desired function/constant.</p>

<p>To specify argument lists for functions we use some special characters (like in regular expressions or extended Backus-Naur Form).
The arguments are placed in angle brackets. The following characters may occur after single arguments 
or argument groups (in round brackets):</p>

<ul>
  <li>* : 0 or more occurrences</li>
  <li>+ : 1 or more occurrences</li>
  <li>? : 0 or 1 occurrences, alternatively [ ... ]</li>
</ul>
