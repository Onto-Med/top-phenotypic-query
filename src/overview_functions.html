<h1>Functions</h1>

<p>The functions described here can be used in the expression editor of the TOP Framework.</p>

<p>Each expression represents either a phenotype class, a constant or a function with a set of
arguments (which are also expressions) and has a particular data type (number, string,
boolean or date/time). For example, a number expression is either a numeric phenotype
class (e.g. weight), a numeric constant (e.g. pi or 5) or a function returning a number
expression. A function converts its arguments into a single expression (usually a
value) of a defined data type.</p>

<p>The functions are grouped by category (package). For detailed information about a function, 
please click on the corresponding package and then on the desired function.</p>
